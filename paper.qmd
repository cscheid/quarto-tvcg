This template is for papers of VGTC-sponsored conferences such as IEEE
VIS, IEEE VR, and ISMAR which are published as special issues of
TVCG. The template does not contain the respective dates of the
conference/journal issue, these will be entered by IEEE as part of the
publication production process. Therefore, **please leave the
copyright statement at the bottom-left of this first page untouched**.

# Using the Sytle Template

* If you receive compilation errors along the lines of `Package ifpdf
  Error: Name clash, \ifpdf is already defined` then please add a new
  line `\let\ifpdf\relax` right after the
  `\documentclass[journal]{vgtc}` call. Note that your error is due to
  packages you use that define "`\ifpdf`" which is obsolete (the
  result is that `\ifpdf` is defined twice); these packages should be
  changed to use ifpdf package instead.
  
* Note that each author's affiliations have to be provided in the
  author footer on the bottom-left corner of the first page. It is
  permitted to merge two or more people from the same institution as
  long as they are shown in the same order as in the overall author
  sequence on the top of the first page. For example, if authors A, B,
  C, and D are from institutions 1, 2, 1, and 2, respectively, then it
  is ok to use 2 bullets as follows:
  
  * A and C are with Institution 1. E-mail: {a, c}@i1.com .
  * B and D are with Institution 2. E-mail: {b, d}@i2.org .
